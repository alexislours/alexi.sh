A few years ago, bookmarklets (or favlets) were a lot more common than they are now. Most of their common features were either implemented in browsers or turned into extensions.

At times, they still remain the easiest way to quickly extend a browser's functionality without having to find an extension.

This is also a solution that works across all major browsers, be it Safari, Firefox or any Chromium based browsers.

## Creating a bookmarklet

A bookmarklet is simply JavaScript code starting with the `javascript:` URL scheme.

There are 3 ways to create a bookmarklet:

1. Using an [Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE):

```js
javascript: (function () {
  // your code
})();

// using arrow functions
javascript: (() => {
  // your code
})();
```

2. Using the `void` operator:

```js
javascript: void (function () {
  // your code
})();
```

3. Directly calling a native function:

```js
javascript: window.open("https://example.com");
```

## Sharing a bookmarklet

Bookmarklets can be shared in two ways:

- Manually adding the bookmarklet to your browser's bookmarks
- Creating an HTML link as follows that can be dragged into the bookmark bar:

```html
<a href="javascript:(/** your code **/)()">Bookmarklet</a>
```

Bookmarklets are generally minified into a single line of code to be embedded in your HTML.

## Examples of bookmarklets

Open the current page in the site archive.ph to bypass paywalls or archive it:

```js
javascript: window.open("https://archive.ph/" + location.href, "_blank");
```

Open the current page in the Wayback Machine:

```js
javascript: window.open(
  "https://web.archive.org/web/*/" + location.href,
  "_blank"
);
```

Scroll to the top of the page:

```js
javascript: window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: "smooth" });
```

Enter edit mode:

```js
javascript: (() => {
  document.body.contentEditable !== "true"
    ? (document.body.contentEditable = "true")
    : (document.body.contentEditable = "false");
})();
```
