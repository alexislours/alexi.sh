JavaScript has some features that surprisingly few people know about. In this post, I'll talk about some of those features.

## `void` operator

The `void` operator is one with a funny history.
Before ES6, `undefined` wasn't a reserved keyword in JavaScript and thus could be overwritten.

```js
undefined = "foo";
let a;
console.log(a == undefined); // false
```

The void operator **_always_** returns `undefined` after evaluating the expression, no matter what the resulting value of the expression is.

```js
void 0; // undefined
void 0; // undefined
void 1 + 1; // undefined
```

The `void` operator can also be used with [immediately-invoked function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) over parenthesis wrapping, but this should be avoided for the sake of readability.

```js
// with parenthesis wrapping
(function() {
    console.log("Hello");
})();

// using the void operator
void function() {
    console.log("Hello");
}();

// Uncaught SyntaxError
function() {
    console.log("Hello");
}();
```

It can also be used with arrow functions to avoid anything being returned if another function is called.

```js
const doSomething = () => void someOtherFunction();
```

## Labeled loops

You can label loops in JavaScript using any non-reserved keywords.
These labels can then be used to break out of nested loops or use the `continue` keyword.

```js
let i, j;

top: for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    console.log("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
    if (i === 1 && j === 1) {
      break top; // will break out of top when i = 1 and j = 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Comma operator

The comma operator evaluate each operand from left to right and returns the last one.
This can be useful to make shorter lambda functions or modify and assign variables in a single statement.

```js
const multiply = (x, y) => (console.log(x, y), x * y);

let x = 1;
x = (x++, x); // x = 2
```

## The `arguments` object

Every JavaScript functions have an `arguments` array-like object that contains the arguments passed to the function. This object has most been replaced by the ES6 `...` spread operator since it isn't available in arrow functions but it is still likely to find it in legacy code bases.

```js
function toCSV() {
  return Array.from(arguments).join(",");
}
toCSV(1, 2, 3); // "1,2,3"
```

Using the spread operator:

```js
const toCSV = (...args) => {
  return Array.from(args).join(",");
};
toCSV(1, 2, 3); // "1,2,3"
```

## The `debugger` statement

The `debugger` statement can be used to set a breakpoint in the code. It can be useful as quick way to set a breakpoint if your IDE doesn't integrate with a browser for example.

```js
debugger;
// some code to debug
```

## Function properties

JavaScript functions can have properties. This can be used to store data that is related to the function.

```js
function foo() {
  foo.executionCount++;
  if (foo.executionCount === 3) {
    console.log("executed 3 times");
  }
}
foo.executionCount = 0;
```
