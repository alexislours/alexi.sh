This post is intended to be a list of apps I frequently use on macOS for work and personally. It's not intended to be a list of the best apps for a specific task, but rather a list of apps I often use and like.

The list is in no particular order and some of these apps are not free.

## Table of contents

## CLI

### Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS. It allows installing and updating packages from the command line.

I use it to manage all the other CLI tools I use, desktop apps and also fonts.

### ZStandard

[ZStandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) is a compression algorithm made by Facebook. I use it when I need to compress anything that I don't intend to share with anyone else.

For example, to compress a folder, I would use:

```
$ tar -cf folder.tar alexi.sh
$ zstd -r --rm -T0 -19 folder.tar
```

### Exa

[Exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) is a drop-in replacement for `ls` made in Rust with a more colorful output.

I use it with the following aliases:

```bash
alias ls='exa --color=always --group-directories-first'
alias lsal='exa -al --color=always --group-directories-first'
alias lsa='exa -a --color=always --group-directories-first'
alias lsl='exa -l --color=always --group-directories-first'
alias lst='exa -T --color=always --group-directories-first'
alias lsat='exa -aT --color=always --group-directories-first'
```

## Desktop apps
