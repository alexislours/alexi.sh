To be completely upfront, I don't think Paris and its surroundings are great places for birding.
The city itself is a concrete jungle, and the surrounding area is mostly farmland.
There are a few good spots, but you'll have to travel a bit to get to them.

I've been birding around Paris for a few years now and I've decided to create this list of the best places I've found so far for people who are interested in birding in the area.

This list will only include places inside the Ile-de-France region, which is the administrative region that includes Paris and its suburbs. It is also highly opinionated and based on my own experience.

Pictures of birds are my own and were taken in the place they are associated with. The "common species" only includes species you're likely to see, and is not an exhaustive list of all the species present in the area.
